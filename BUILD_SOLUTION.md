# Flutter Build Solution for Windows

## Issue Fixed
The main code issues that were causing build failures have been resolved:

1. **Fixed `_onBoardTap` method in `board_view.dart`**: 
   - Removed incorrect type casting of `details.globalPosition as BuildContext`
   - Added proper `BuildContext` parameter to the method
   - Updated method signature and call site

2. **Added error handling in `board_controller.dart`**:
   - Added try-catch blocks around engine initialization
   - Added proper error handling for engine switching
   - Added safe state fallbacks when engine initialization fails

3. **Fixed test file**:
   - Updated `test/widget_test.dart` to match the actual app structure
   - Fixed import statements and test cases

## Remaining Issue: Vietnamese Characters in Path

The build is still failing due to Vietnamese characters in the project path:
```
C:\Users\quocn\OneDrive\Máy tính\CSAI\group7\PikafishVsEleeye\flutter_application_1
```

This is a known limitation with Flutter on Windows when the project path contains non-ASCII characters.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Move Project to ASCII Path (Recommended)
Move the project to a path without special characters:
```
C:\Users\quocn\OneDrive\Desktop\CSAI\group7\PikafishVsEleeye\flutter_application_1
```

### Option 2: Use Short Path Names
Create a symbolic link or use Windows short path names to avoid the special characters.

### Option 3: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Run Flutter commands from within WSL where path encoding is handled differently.

## Verification
The code fixes have been verified using `flutter analyze` which shows no critical errors, only warnings about print statements (which are acceptable for debugging).

## Next Steps
1. Move the project to a path without special characters
2. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
3. Try building again with `flutter build windows`

The application code is now ready and should build successfully once the path issue is resolved.
